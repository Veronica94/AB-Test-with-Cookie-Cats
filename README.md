# AB-Test-with-Cookie-Cats

This is a AB test project from *datacamp*. 

The project aims to find out if the retention rate for a puzzle game, **Cookie Cats**, will be higher when the gate (i.e. force users to stop for a non-trivial time or make in-app purchase) is moved to level 40 as compare to level 30.

The conclusion is interesting. Despite popular convention *The later the gate, the higher the retention rate*, data shows the opposite. From my analysis, retention rate is much higher when the gate is at level 30.
